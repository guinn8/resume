# Profile

Embedded Engineer with 3 years of experience developing production-grade C/C++ software for microcontrollers and Linux environments. Demonstrated success in leading teams, mentoring interns, and managing complex firmware projects from design to deployment. In my spare time I enjoy spending my time skiing in the Rocky Mountains and experimenting with generative AI.

*Based in Calgary, Canada, and seeking opportunities locally, nationally, and internationally.*
