# Profile

Embedded Engineer with 3 years of experience developing production-grade C/C++ software for microcontrollers and Linux environments. Demonstrated success in leading teams, mentoring interns, and managing complex firmware projects from design to deployment. In my spare time I enjoy spending my time skiing in the Rocky Mountains and experimenting with generative AI. Based in Calgary, Canada, and seeking opportunities locally, nationally, and internationally.

# Education

## Bachelor of Science in Computer Science -- University of Calgary

    May 2018 - May 2022

**GPA:** 3.49/4.00  

# Work Experience

## Firmware Engineer -- Simply Embedded  

    Jan 2021 - May 2024

- **Firmware Development:** Engineered robust RTOS C/C++ firmware solutions on 32-bit ARM microcontrollers. Professionally utilized git for version control, managed devops and releases with Jenkins.
- **Quality Assurance:** Conducted thorough unit testing and collaborated closely with the QA team to ensure high-quality firmware releases. Collaborated with Electrical Engineers in developing firmware for hardware test fixtures.
- **Peripheral Driver Development**: Developed and maintained drivers for peripherals (audio, display, touch, modem, secure element, IMU) within a FreeRTOS environment, ensuring seamless hardware-software integration.
- **Advanced Debugging Techniques:** Utilized logic analyzers and oscilloscopes to debug bus protocols (UART, SPI, I2C, CAN). Employed emulation tools like QEMU to debug and validate driver quality.
- **Mentorship and Hiring:** Led the interview and selection process for five engineering interns, providing hands-on training in  firmware development and debugging to ensure they quickly became productive team members.
- **Network Security:** Utilized TCP/IP stack and security protocols to manage secure communications, including certificate management. Developed OTA firmware updates as a key feature, ensuring reliable deployments over HTTPS.
- **Client Engagement:** Excelled in client interactions, from cold conversations at tradeshows (CES 23/24) to in-depth meetings during international trips. Experienced in converting customer business needs to concrete development objectives.

## Retail Sales Staff -- Camperâ€™s Village

    May 2014 - July 2021

- **High Service Sales:** Engaged with customers to understand their requirements and recommend the best camping products.

# Other Experience

## President -- Computer Science Undergraduate Society

    Sept 2020 - Feb 2021

- **Organized CalgaryHacks 2021:** Led a 20-member volunteer team, bringing together over 700 participants and distributing $15,000 in prizes, fostering growth in Calgary's tech community.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Managed sales, from package development to payments, with outside sponsors. Facilitated regular meetings with the Computer Science Department to report on club activities.
- **COVID-19 Adaptation:** Successfully transitioned CalgaryHacks to a remote format, leveraging Discord and Zoom for seamless event execution, communication, and judging.

## Project in Theoretical Computer Science -- NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award  

    Sept 2021 - Apr 2022

- **Mathematical Research:** Studied computational number theory under  Dr. Michael J. Jacobson, using algorithms and computational methods to explore Aliquot sequences, contributing to the understanding of their statistical properties and behaviors.
- **High-Performance Compute:** Developed scalable and parallel algorithms in C and OpenMP, effectively leveraging an 800GB RAM, 80-thread research cluster to optimize the computation of Aliquot sequences.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Produced a thorough undergraduate thesis and Doxygen-generated code documentation, providing a clear foundation for future research on Aliquot sequences.
