Re: Application for Software Developer at Seequent

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Developer position at Seequent in Calgary. Ever since my university courses ignited my fascination with computational geometry and visualization, I've been eager to apply my C++ expertise to develop software that brings the subsurface to life. With over three years of experience developing production-grade C++ software for embedded systems and Linux environments, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.

In my previous role as a firmware engineer, I engineered robust C++ solutions on 32-bit ARM microcontrollers, focusing on object-oriented design and complex problem-solving. One of my favorite projects involved developing GUIs for IoT devices, where I honed my skills in 3D visualization and user interface development. This experience has given me a strong foundation that I believe will translate well to working on 3D slope stability and finite element geotechnical analysis products like BUILD3D and SLOPE3D.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with technologies such as VTK and OpenCascade. While my background is in embedded systems, I have a keen interest in 3D geometry handling and am eager to expand my expertise in this area. I thrive in environments that foster innovation and continuous learning, and I am enthusiastic about contributing to Seequent's mission of helping create a better understanding of the underground.

Collaboration is one of my strengths, and I have always enjoyed working in cross-functional teams. In my previous role, I collaborated closely with QA developers, research engineers, and product managers to deliver high-quality software. I also have experience mentoring less experienced team members, which aligns with your focus on team development and knowledge sharing.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with Seequent's needs.
