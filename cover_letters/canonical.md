Re: Application for Embedded Linux Consultant at Canonical

I am writing to express my interest in the Embedded Linux Consultant position available at Canonical. It may sound like a cliché, but Linux has been an essential part of my life since I installed Ubuntu as my primary desktop OS in 2017. As a C programmer, having access to the Linux source code has been an absolute delight. I’ve spent enough time debugging faulty TTY ACM drivers to appreciate the technical prowess behind kernel development.

In my previous role as a consulting firmware engineer, client relations were a key part of my responsibilities. During a multi-year IoT product development contract, I took accountability for a major firmware overhaul, requiring close coordination between our team in Canada and the client’s team in Europe. I had the opportunity to travel to Europe twice for weeklong in-person meetings, which significantly accelerated feature development by eliminating delays caused by time zone differences. I find the prospect of traveling to meet clients face-to-face particularly exciting. Additionally, I represented my previous company at CES 2023/24, where I had the chance to briefly chat with Canonical’s embedded Linux team.

As a firmware engineer, the bulk of my day-to-day work involved developing applications in C for ARM microcontrollers using FreeRTOS. I spent much of my time developing device drivers (I2C, SPI, UART, etc.) and creating network-enabled GUIs for IoT products. Debugging these features required writing comprehensive custom test cases in Python to ensure the protocol between the device and Azure IoT Hub was correct. One of the aspects I enjoyed most in my previous role was taking accountability for new feature development, as it allowed me to continually learn and grow as a developer.
I hope you will consider me for the role of Embedded Linux Consultant. I am confident that I can provide excellent customer service and engineering expertise to Canonical’s clients.
