Re: Application for Software Developer Position

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position on the Zero Trust team at Cloudflare. With over three years of experience developing production-grade firmware in C for embedded systems and Linux environments, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. I am particularly eager to expand my skills into Rust, building on my extensive experience with C and systems programming.

In my previous role at Simply Embedded, I developed and debugged networking firmware for ARM microcontrollers, dealing with complex TCP/IP issues and ensuring device reliability in challenging conditions. I’ve worked extensively on multithreaded, asynchronous code and have a deep understanding of core OS concepts such as memory management and process lifecycles.

I am highly motivated to contribute to Cloudflare’s Zero Trust desktop client and see this role as an exciting opportunity to further develop my expertise in systems programming while learning Rust. I’m confident my background in C, networking, and systems development will allow me to make an impact.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with your needs.
