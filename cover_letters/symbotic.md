Re: Application for Embedded Software Developer - WiFi Mesh & Router Protocols

I am writing to express my interest in the Embedded Software Developer position specializing in WiFi Mesh & Router Protocols at Symboticware. Being based in Calgary, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team in person and be a part of your innovative journey in developing cutting-edge IoT products.

In my previous role as a firmware engineer at Simply Embedded, I accumulated over three years of professional experience developing production-grade C/C++ software for embedded systems. My work focused extensively on networking devices and IoT applications, where I programmed at the network interface level utilizing protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, DNS, and DHCP. I have hands-on experience ensuring reliable data transmission over CAT-M LTE networks, developing secure communication features with robust error handling and encryption to meet stringent network security standards.

While at Simply Embedded, I collaborated closely with hardware and systems teams to ensure seamless integration of software with networking hardware. I am proficient in advanced debugging techniques, regularly utilizing tools like GDB, JTAG, logic analyzers, and oscilloscopes to troubleshoot complex embedded systems issues. This experience has honed my ability to diagnose and resolve intricate problems, particularly in environments that demand high reliability and performance.

I have also worked on customizing open-source platforms, including modifying and recompiling a fork of the QEMU source to accurately emulate the Cortex-M7 platform. This experience parallels the requirements of working with and customizing platforms like OpenWRT, aligning well with the needs of the position at Symboticware.

Symboticware's mission to disrupt traditional industries with AI-driven solutions resonates deeply with my professional interests. I am excited about the prospect of working on WiFi Mesh networking devices to create robust, scalable solutions that enhance connectivity and performance in IoT platforms.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my experience and skills align closely with the requirements of the Embedded Software Developer role. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Symboticware's innovative projects.
