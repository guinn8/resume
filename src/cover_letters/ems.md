Re: Application for Software Developer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Developer position at Millennium EMS Solutions. As an intermediate developer with over three years of experience in production-grade C/C++ software for embedded systems and Linux environments, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team. My professional experience, including firmware development at Simply Embedded, has equipped me with expertise in designing robust solutions and collaborating across teams to deliver high-quality products.

At Simply Embedded, I engineered C/C++ firmware for ARM microcontrollers, utilizing Git for version control and Jenkins for DevOps processes, which aligns with your requirements for version control and DevOps skills. My experience with CI/CD pipelines, combined with my ongoing development of skills in the Microsoft stack (.NET, C#, and SQL Server), ensures I can contribute effectively to your software projects.

I am particularly inspired by a recent experience accompanying a friend on a Ducks Unlimited project. I saw how inefficiencies in GIS software forced him to spend hours on manual, automatable tasks. This reinforced my passion for building software that improves field efficiency, and I am eager to help create software that reduces workload for users in demanding environments.

Additionally, my skills in debugging, collaboration, and mentoring—including leading the training of interns at Simply Embedded—further highlight my adaptability and teamwork. I am confident that my technical background, combined with my passion for creating impactful software, will allow me to make a meaningful contribution to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your organization.
