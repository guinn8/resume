Re: Application for Firmware Developer, Prospero Intergrated

I am writing to express my interest in the Firmware Developer position based in Calgary. With over three years of hands-on experience developing C firmware for embedded systems, I am confident that my background aligns well with the needs of the A/V product development team.

In my previous role, I designed and implemented firmware for IoT devices utilizing ARM microcontrollers and FreeRTOS. I developed drivers for peripherals with interfaces such as I2C, SPI, UART, and USB, gaining a keen appreciation for debugging tools like digital logic analyzers and oscilloscopes. This experience enabled me to quickly establish communication with a variety of peripheral devices, such as a DAC driving a speaker on an IoT product. My favorite projects always involved close collaboration with electrical engineering teams, a passion I hope to bring to this role.

In a recent project, I managed a significant pivot in customer requirements, designing and implementing firmware to meet revised architectural and functional requirements, along with performance and quality metrics. I worked from high-level sales presentations to break down goals into actionable Jira cards. This process required close collaboration with all stakeholders to ensure that the project scope presented a manageable timeline. I focused on reducing or backlogging tasks when necessary to keep the project on track. Personally, and as part of a team of developers, I worked diligently to develop these objectives, ensuring that we met both technical and business needs.

Being based in Calgary, I am excited about the opportunity to work onsite and directly contribute to your innovative audio and video conferencing systems. I am confident that my skills in embedded firmware, alongside my hands-on debugging and driver development experience, make me well-suited to help advance your product lines.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
