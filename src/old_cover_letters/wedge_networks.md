Re: Application for Intermediate Software Developer at Wedge Networks (Competition: CALISD201909)

I am writing to express my interest in the Intermediate Software Developer position (Competition: CALISD201909) at Wedge Networks. I have over three years of experience developing production-grade C firmware for IoT products, which required a strong background in networking to handle offloading sensor and telemetry data to the cloud using a cellular modem. Utilizing Linux as a firmware development environment, I have developed my Bash and Python scripting skills to automate debugging and testing tasks.

In my previous role, I gained extensive experience debugging Layer 6 networking issues in cellular-connected IoT products. This involved developing edge-case handling for TCP, where packets often fail to be delivered reliably. By implementing robust error-handling mechanisms, I enhanced a wearable IoT product with immediate error prompts, improving user experience and increasing device reliability under challenging network conditions.

Additionally, I have hands-on experience with kernel development while debugging a faulty ACM TTY driver on an IoT device that prevented reading debug output on Linux. I delved into the kernel module code, bypassed error handling, and recompiled and reloaded the driver. While this led to a kernel panic, it provided valuable experience and deepened my understanding of Linux system internals.

I am particularly impressed by Wedge Networks' focus on real-time threat prevention and your innovative WedgeARP platform. I am curious about how Wedge Networks rolls out infrastructure to handle the computationally intensive threat detection tasks, especially considering the demands on network equipment and deployment. I have some hands-on experience with managing network equipment in my home network, such as configuring port forwarding to serve a website. While this is on a smaller scale, I understand the importance of efficient deployment and configuration of network resources, which aligns with my interest in your solutions.

With my foundation in C, C++, Java, Python, and my experience with UNIX/Linux systems, I am eager to contribute to your R&D team. I am well-versed in network technologies (TCP/IP, Layer 7 protocols) and have experience in RESTful API designâ€”both critical components of your solutions. My familiarity with structured and unstructured databases and SCRUM methodologies would help me thrive in your agile development environment.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your needs at Wedge Networks. Thank you for considering my application.
