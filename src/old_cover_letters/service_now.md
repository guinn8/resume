Re: Application for ServiceNow Developer at Infosys

I am writing to express my interest in the ServiceNow Developer position at Infosys. With over three years of experience developing production-grade C/C++ software for embedded systems and Linux environments, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.

In my previous role as a firmware engineer, I worked closely with clients and cross-functional teams to deliver robust solutions. I have experience in all stages of the software development life cycle, from requirements gathering to deployment. My background includes integrating complex systems and managing projects that required both technical proficiency and strong communication skills.

While my expertise has been in embedded systems, I am eager to expand into enterprise service management. I am a quick learner and have a strong foundation in software development principles, which I believe will enable me to adapt rapidly to new technologies like ServiceNow. My experience with scripting in Python and Bash, as well as using version control systems like Git and CI/CD tools like Jenkins, aligns with the technical requirements of this role.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with Infosys's global team and contribute to large-scale digital transformation projects. I value collaboration and have experience working with teams across different time zones, which I believe will be beneficial in this position.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs.
