# Work Experience

## Embedded Software Developer -- Simply Embedded  

    Jan 2021 - May 2024

- **System Testing:** Designed and executed system-level test plans covering embedded firmware, hardware, and user interfaces. Conducted regression testing to ensure consistent performance across updates.
- **Firmware Development:** Built and tested robust RTOS-based firmware solutions in C/C++ for ARM microcontrollers. Debugged hardware-software interactions using tools like GDB, JLink and logic analyzers.
- **Quality Assurance:**  Developed and executed test plans to validate circuit boards and commission assembled products. Designed comprehensive validation checklists, including over 50 criteria, to ensure products shipped to the customer were consistent.
- **Python Development:** Forked a substantial open-source Python project, using OOP design principles to customize the tool for internal QA use. Extensively used Python to unit-test the network-based features of embedded devices.
- **Debugging Electrical Systems:**  Experienced with  debugging digital electrical systems, including analyzing schematics, and troubleshooting circuits. Skilled in using tools like multi-meters and oscilloscopes, as well as basic soldering to validate hardware.
- **Client Engagement:** Excelled in client interactions, from cold conversations at tradeshows (CES 23/24) to in-depth meetings during international trips. Experienced in converting customer business needs to concrete development objectives.
- **GUI Design:** Led the development of user interfaces for multiple embedded projects, developing resource constrained GUI's using LVGL. Worked iteratively with clients to refine device HMI, ensuring our products are accessible.

## Research Assistant -- University of Calgary

    Sept 2021 - Apr 2022

- **Mathematical Research:** Studied computational number theory under  Dr. Michael J. Jacobson, using algorithms and computational methods to explore Aliquot sequences, contributing to the understanding of their statistical properties.
- **High-Performance Compute:** Developed scalable and parallel algorithms in C and OpenMP, effectively leveraging an 800GB RAM, 80-thread research cluster to optimize the computation of Aliquot sequences.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Produced a thorough undergraduate thesis and Doxygen-generated code documentation, providing a clear foundation for future research on Aliquot sequences.
