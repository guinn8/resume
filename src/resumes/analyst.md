# Work Experience

## Embedded Firmware Developer -- Simply Embedded  

    Jan 2021 - May 2024

- **Firmware Development:** Engineered robust RTOS C/C++ firmware solutions on 32-bit ARM microcontrollers, ensuring high reliability. Utilized Linux as a primary development environment and maintained professional version control with Git.
- **Data Analysis with Python:** Leveraged Python to automate product testing as part of manufacturing. Built processes to extract and store device test output to ensure traceable QC processes.
- **Technical Leadership:** Led the interview and selection process for five engineering interns, providing hands-on training in firmware development and debugging to ensure they quickly became productive team members.
- **Quality Assurance:** Conducted root-cause analysis on device telemetry data to identify inconsistencies, I collaborated closely with the QA team to document issues and implement solutions.
- **Client Engagement:** Excelled in client interactions, from cold conversations at tradeshows (CES 23/24) to in-depth meetings during international trips. Experienced in converting customer business needs to concrete development objectives.
- **Data Management:** Utilized SQL for querying and managing device telemetry data stored in Azure. Analyzed large datasets to conduct root-cause analysis and work closely with the QA team to document issues and implement solutions.
- **Agile Project Management:** Experienced in software development environments, from collaborating on Git-based projects with teams of 20+ members to leading a small agile team with Jira to deliver a prototype product.

## Research in Theoretical Computer Science -- NSERC Research Award

    Sept 2021 - Apr 2022

- **Mathematical Research:** Studied computational number theory under  Dr. Michael J. Jacobson, using algorithms and computational methods to explore Aliquot sequences, contributing to the understanding of their statistical properties.
- **High-Performance Compute:** Developed scalable and parallel algorithms in C and OpenMP, effectively leveraging an 800GB RAM, 80-thread research cluster to optimize the computation of Aliquot sequences.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Produced a thorough undergraduate thesis and Doxygen-generated code documentation, providing a clear foundation for future research on Aliquot sequences.
