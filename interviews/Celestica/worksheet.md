## Technical Questions (C++ and RTOS)

### 1. What are the key features of C++ that make it suitable for embedded systems?

- **Activity:** Discuss object-oriented programming, memory management, and performance considerations.
- **Prompt:** Explain how these features help in managing hardware resources efficiently.

**Your Answer:**

- C++ is suitable for embedded system because it enables developers to use powerful abstractions like OOP to write compact high-performance code.
- OOP in enables a programmer to design interfaces that neatly abstracts a peripheral, like a LCD display, this  design makes it easy to write a new concrete implementation if there is a need to support a new part.
- C++ offers low-level pointer manipulation to build hardware specific features like a bootloader while providing high-level tools like Smart Pointers as a tool to avoid memory leaks.
- The compiler infrastructure around C++ is very robust, providing developers compile-time optimization options (-O2)that can substantially increase performance.

### 2. Explain the concept of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) in C++. How does it help in resource management?

- **Activity:** Highlight how RAII can prevent resource leaks in embedded applications.
- **Prompt:** Discuss scenarios where improper resource management led to system failures.

**Your Answer:**

- RAII is a design principle supported by C++ which helps prevents memory leaks and use-before-initialization errors. For instance a file opened using the RAII idiom would automatically be closed when the function exits, preventing the resource from leaking.  
- I worked on a memorable memory-leak when designing a system that dynamically rendered applications in LVGL8. Specifically we needed to allocate memory for each application received by the network and then pass that pointer into the graphics library. The destructors for objects in the graphics library did not correctly deallocate this network memory resulting in a memory leak and eventually a crash.

### 3. How do you handle exceptions in C++? What strategies do you use in an embedded environment?

- **Activity:** Discuss the implications of exceptions in real-time systems and alternatives like error codes.
- **Prompt:** Elaborate on why certain strategies are preferred in embedded systems compared to general applications.

**Your Answer:**

- In C++ exceptions dynamically allocate memory, resulting in potentially unpredictable behavior on resource constrained devices.  
- Error codes are often preferred in embedded development
forcing the developer to build explicit error handling.

### 4. What is the role of pointers in C++, and how do you manage memory effectively in embedded systems?

- **Activity:** Talk about dynamic memory allocation and potential pitfalls.
- **Prompt:** Provide examples of how improper pointer management can lead to memory leaks or crashes.

**Your Answer:**

- In C++ the programmer is provided with a variety of ways to manage memory, including manually allocating memory. If a pointer created is way is not properly free'ed using an explicit function call the memory will leak and become unusable.
- When allocating memory on the heap the programmer should be careful to consider the lifetime of the object to ensure there is a mechanism that correctly frees the memory when it is no longer being used.

### 5. Describe how you would implement a state machine in C++. What design patterns might you use?

- **Activity:** Mention patterns like the State pattern and how they apply to embedded systems.
- **Prompt:** Discuss the benefits of using design patterns in improving code maintainability and readability.

**Your Answer:**

- The State pattern describes an object which changes behavior based on a stored state, a traffic light being a classic example.
- In C++ this would be implemented by defining a abstract class representing the concept of updating state, this abstract class would be made concrete for each specific state. A class would need to be defined which holds the current state as a field.
- Using common common design patterns like this makes it easy to extend code in the future, if you need a single new state just write a concrete class rather than rewritng spaghetti

### 6. How do you optimize C++ code for performance in an embedded environment?

- **Activity:** Discuss techniques like loop unrolling, inlining, and minimizing memory usage.
- **Prompt:** Share specific examples of optimizations you've implemented in past projects.

**Your Answer:**

- Find a way to profile the performance of a embedded system, whether this manually adding timing functionality of a critical

- **Activity:** Compare their scheduling algorithms and resource management.
- **Prompt:** Discuss scenarios where one might be preferred over the other.

**Your Answer:**

---

- **Prompt:** Expand on how timers can improve system responsiveness.

### 9. How do you ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources in an RTOS?

- **Activity:** Talk about mutexes, semaphores, and critical sections.
- **Prompt:** Provide examples of potential issues that can arise without proper synchronization.

**Your Answer:**

### 10. What debugging tools do you use for C++ applications in embedded systems?
